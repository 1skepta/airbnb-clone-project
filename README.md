# airbnb-clone-project
Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# Team Roles
1. Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
2. Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
3. DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
4. QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
1. Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
2. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. Redis: Used for caching and session management.
7. Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
1. Users
   
  GET /users/ - List all users

  POST /users/ - Create a new user

  GET /users/{user_id}/ - Retrieve a specific user

  PUT /users/{user_id}/ - Update a specific user

  DELETE /users/{user_id}/ - Delete a specific user
  

3. Properties
   
  GET /properties/ - List all properties
  
  POST /properties/ - Create a new property
  
  GET /properties/{property_id}/ - Retrieve a specific property
  
  PUT /properties/{property_id}/ - Update a specific property
  
  DELETE /properties/{property_id}/ - Delete a specific property
  

5. Bookings
   
  GET /bookings/ - List all bookings
  
  POST /bookings/ - Create a new booking
  
  GET /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Retrieve a specific booking
  
  PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Update a specific booking
  
  DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Delete a specific booking
  

7. Payments
   
POST /payments/ - Process a payment


9. Reviews
    
  GET /reviews/ - List all reviews
  
  POST /reviews/ - Create a new review
  
  GET /reviews/{review_id}/ - Retrieve a specific review
  
  PUT /reviews/{review_id}/ - Update a specific review
  
  DELETE /reviews/{review_id}/ - Delete a specific review

# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# API Security
1. User Authentication
   
  Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
  
  Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
  

2. Property Management
   
  Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
  
  Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings
  

3. Payment Processing
   
  Endpoints: /payments/
  
  Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a method of automating the process of building, testing, and deploying applications to ensure rapid and reliable software delivery.
1. GitHub Actions – Automates workflows for testing and deploying code.
2. Docker – Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
